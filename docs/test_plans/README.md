# Test Plans

This is a location to record all test plans that are covering celestia's ecosystem.

A Test plan should be good if the following conditions are met:

- Short and simple
- Introduction
- In-Scope
- Out-of-Scope
- Risks
- Entry Conditions
- Exit Conditions
- Timescales
- People
- Test Environment

You can include additional chapters of your choice. Still remember to be efficient, as long reads are good sign to split (not considering master test plans)

## Template

Please consider using our template: [test-plan-template](./tp-template.md)

## Plan vs Strategy

If you want to consider creating a test strategy, make sure to create a separate dir for it.
